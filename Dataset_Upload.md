The data uploaded to the uploader: https://bioart.io/ was downloaded from the Gene Network page: https://genenetwork.org/show_trait?trait_id=24668&dataset=BXDPublish. The dataset is a phenotype matrix of the BXD mouse group with the phenotype ID: BXD_24668. The paper is found at: https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/81/13_Supplement/2919/668784/Abstract-2919-Novel-pre-clinical-model-to-identify and is titled: Novel pre-clinical model to identify genetic modifiers of triple negative breast cancer. 

The main focus of the research is on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer that has poor prognosis. The identification of genetic modifiers that influence the vulnerability and progression of TNBC is crucial for enhancing personalized and predictive treatments. The researchers' hypothesis is that by utilizing a well-established recombinant inbred strain, they can discover new genetic modifiers using a novel model that affect the risk and aggressiveness of TNBC. The insights gained from the research will contribute to significant advancements in understanding the risk factors associated with TNBC and ultimately improving outcomes for patients with breast cancer.
